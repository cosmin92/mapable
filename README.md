Mapable is the name of the project developed for the exam of the Mobile Application and Cloud Computing course provided by the faculty of "Ingegneria Informatica e Automatica", degree course "Master of Science in Engineering in Coputer Science".

## Introduction
The aim of the project is to provide a platform for the exchange of information on the state of viability of the places used to emit architectural barriers. In particular, the aim is to provide an information exchange tool to disabled people in order to improve the knowledge of the above-mentioned places in a preventive way.

The protagonists are therefore the disabled people themselves who contribute personally to the information system, specifying through specific modules the state of degradation of the architectural barriers.

Each user of the platform can therefore consult, modify, update and contribute to information regarding a specific construction in a public or private place open to the public.
## Description
The project has two parts. This repository contains the first part, that is the back end code of the application and the front end concerning the consultation of information from the browser. The second part is the mobile application which can be found at the following [link](https://www.google.com).
## Tools
The tools used for this project are manifold. First of all, [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) is used as a database management system, a simple and fast solution. Furthermore SQLite is opensource. On top of SQLite3 we have the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment that underlies all server-side code. Express and SQlite3 support modules are added to Node.js in order to increase the productivity. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications (see more about express at [link](https://expressjs.com/)). The second is used for interfacing with DBMS SQLite3 (for more information see the main page by following this [link](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)).
